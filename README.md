# Repository of my mpv scripts and configs

## Configs

The config files in ```fonts.conf``` and ```mpv.conf``` are mostly copied from [this guide](https://iamscum.wordpress.com/guides/videoplayback-guide/mpv-conf/).

## Scripts
I primarily only use 2 scripts, one for autoloading videos from folders and another for easy webm making.
- autoload : automatically load files from folder as playlist
- webm: easy webm maker from video
