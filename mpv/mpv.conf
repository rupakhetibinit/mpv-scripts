#Lazy quality profile which sets some recommended settings 
profile=gpu-hq

#All of the settings can be found further down in the guide
#Setting the profile is not needed, but it doesn't hurt
#You can overwrite the settings without any issue
#Here is a list of the settings "gpu-hq" sets:
#scale=spline36
#cscale=spline36
#dscale=mitchell
#dither-depth=auto
#correct-downscaling=yes
#linear-downscaling=yes
#sigmoid-upscaling=yes
#deband=yes

#You might want to tweak scale/cscale/dscale better and turn deband for all sources off, since it can result in unnecessary detail loss


#Video output driver
#Use "gpu" for a more stable output driver instead
#Keep in mind that some options won't work with "gpu"
#See: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/GPU-Next-vs-GPU

#Called API
#Use "opengl" if you have compatibility issues. 
gpu-api=vulkan

#Hardware decoding for whatever your CPU/GPU supports (e.g. 8bit h264 / 10bit h265)
#Only should be used when your CPU/GPU are very old, else avoid using it
#Use "auto-copy-safe" for the safest result in trade of better performance
#You can manually try "dxva2-copy" on Windows, "vaapi" / "vaapi-copy" on Linux or "nvdec" / "nvdec-copy" with a Nvidia GPUs (recommended)
hwdec=no

#Gamma correction for a PC screen (sRGB)
#Not needed for a TV screen (Rec.709/Rec.2020)

#Always open the video player in full screen

#Don't close the player after finishing the video
keep-open=yes

#The last position of your video is saved when quitting mpv

#Start mpv with a % smaller resolution of your screen

#Cursor hide in ms

#Forces showing subtitles while seeking through the video
demuxer-mkv-subtitle-preroll=yes

#Backward compatibility for vsfilter
#Disabling it "no" can result in broken subtitles in older vsfilter subtitles (still recommended)
#Enabling it "yes" can result in broken subtitles in newer libass subtitles
sub-ass-vsfilter-blur-compat=no

#Subtitle blending in scenechanges (smoother effect)
#This is recommended if you use Interpolation
blend-subtitles=yes

#Fixes subtitle timing for gaps smaller than 210ms (works with PGS subtitles)
sub-fix-timing=yes

#Load external subtitles with (almost) the same name as the video 
sub-auto=fuzzy

#Some settings fixing VOB/PGS subtitles (creating blur & changing yellow subs to gray)
